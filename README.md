# Stock-Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict stocks. I have implemented following five models for stock prediction: -

1. Ridge Regression
2. Bayesian Regression
3. Decision Tree Regressor
4. SVM Regressor
5. Gradient Boosting Trees

## Future addition:

I wanted to create a website which have provisions of trading stocks in real time using reinforcement learning, show predictions and also provide betting functionality. But due to submission deadline I could not complete it in time but I am working on it. I hope to create it soon!
